# SOLVING TSP PROBLEM

This code shows how the traveling salesman problem can be solved applying different optimization algorithms.



## How to compile the project?

First, install all the required dependencies. You only need to install OpenCV.

Then, create a build directory
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
```

Run cmake
```
$ cmake ..
```

Run make
```
$ make
```

The executable is named "solving_tsp". Run the 
program as follows
```
$ ./solving_tsp
```
## What problem do we solve?

If you run the program without any parameters, then a number of 9 cities distributed
over a circle is generated. However, you can test different datasets from the LIBTSP repository [1]. 
Simply provide the filename of the .tsp file as the first argument. You 
almost surely have to adjust the parameters in order to get a good approximation.

For a quick test, you can run an example from the data folder, like the following:
```
$ ./solving_tsp ../data/wi29.tsp
```
At the end, the program gives you the shortest path found.
You can compare your results (using your parameters settings) to the optimal result [2]. 

The program only works with instances of type TSP and edge weight type EUC_2D. 

## How do I change the parameters?

All important parameters are defined in the main.cpp file. 
The project has three optimization methods available, which are:
* _Brute force method_: a simple brute force code that tests all possible tours. No parameters required.
* _Simulated Annealing method_ (default):
  * outerLoops_: number of iterations in the external loop for temperature decayment.
  * innerLoops_: number of iterations in the internal loop for simulate the markov chain with a fixed temperature.
  * coolingSchedule_: defines the cooling process using a geometric cooling method with an _initial temperature_ and _decayment factor_ as parameters.
  * notificationCycle_: represents the screen update cycle for notifying the GUI.
* _Genetic Algorithm method_:
  * populationSize: size of population.
  * numGenerations: number of generations.
  * competitorsInTournament: number of competitors in a selection process by tournament.
  * percentageForMutation: a number which must be between 0 and 100 representing the percentage for mutation. 
  
You must choose just one method and comment the other ones. 
Remember to recompile the project once you are finished updating the parameters.
**Warning: The brute force method does not work well for a high number of cities (>10).**

## What do the lines represent?

The yellow line shows the a possible new cycle that has been found so far. The purple
line shows the current best state.

# Rubric Points Addressed
* **The project demonstrates an understanding of C++ functions and control structures.**
* **The project reads data from a file and process the data, or the program writes data to a file.**
* **The project accepts user input and processes the input.**
* **The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques.**
* **Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members.**
* **Class constructors utilize member initialization lists.**
* **Classes abstract implementation details from their interfaces.**
* **Classes encapsulate behavior.**
* **Classes follow an appropriate inheritance hierarchy.**
* **Derived class functions override virtual base class functions.**
* **The project makes use of references in function declarations.**
* **The project uses smart pointers instead of raw pointers.**
