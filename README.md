# SOLVING TSP PROBLEM

This code shows how the traveling salesman problem can be solved applying different optimization algorithms.



## How to compile the project?

First, install all the required dependencies. You only need to install OpenCV.

Then, create a build directory
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
```

Run cmake
```
$ cmake ..
```

Run make
```
$ make
```

The executable is named "solving_tsp". Run the 
program as follows
```
$ ./solving_tsp
```
## What problem do we solve?

If you run the program without any parameters, then a number of 9 cities distributed
over a circle is generated. However, you can test different datasets from the LIBTSP repository [1]. 
Simply provide the filename of the .tsp file as the first argument. You 
almost surely have to adjust the parameters in order to get a good approximation.

For a quick test, you can run an example from the data folder, like the following:
```
$ ./solving_tsp ../data/wi29.tsp
```
At the end, the program gives you the shortest path found.
You can compare your results (using your parameters settings) to the optimal result [2]. 

The program only works with instances of type TSP and edge weight type EUC_2D. 

## How do I change the parameters?

All important parameters are defined in the main.cpp file. 
The project has three optimization methods available, which are:
* _Brute force method_: a simple brute force code that tests all possible tours. No parameters required.
* _Simulated Annealing method_ (default):
  * outerLoops_: number of iterations in the external loop for temperature decayment.
  * innerLoops_: number of iterations in the internal loop for simulate the markov chain with a fixed temperature.
  * coolingSchedule_: defines the cooling process using a geometric cooling method with an _initial temperature_ and _decayment factor_ as parameters.
  * notificationCycle_: represents the screen update cycle for notifying the GUI.
* _Genetic Algorithm method_:
  * populationSize: size of population.
  * numGenerations: number of generations.
  * competitorsInTournament: number of competitors in a selection process by tournament.
  * percentageForMutation: a number which must be between 0 and 100 representing the percentage for mutation. 
  
You must choose just one method and comment the other ones. 
Remember to recompile the project once you are finished updating the parameters.
**Warning: The brute force method does not work well for a high number of cities (>10).**

## What do the lines represent?

The yellow line shows the a possible new cycle that has been found so far. The purple
line shows the current best state.

# Rubric Points Addressed
* **The project demonstrates an understanding of C++ functions and control structures:** Several places in the code. Ex.: Line 18 and line 38 in optimizer.cpp.
* **The project reads data from a file and process the data, or the program writes data to a file:** The program can read a .tsp file that represents and instance of the TSP. Examples can be found on data folder. Line 38 in tsp.cpp.
* **The project accepts user input and processes the input:** The user input are the parameters that can be set in the main.cpp file to tuning the algorithms.
* **The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques:** Several places in the code. The TSP problem is represented by a class as well as the Optimizer to solve the problem. We have several attributes and methods specified accordingly to its purpose. Ex.: Line 10 in sa_optimizer.h and line 10 in ga_optimizer.h.
* **Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members:** Ex.: Line 66, 71, 75 in optimizer.h are protected. So just the children classes can access. We want to ensure that the method setParameters() does not be called externally by the user.
* **Class constructors utilize member initialization lists:** Ex.: Line 46 and 47 in optimizer.h and lines 54, 55, 56, 57, 58 in ga_optimizer.h.
* **Classes abstract implementation details from their interfaces:** Ex.: Line 51 in optimizer.h. The optimize method is implemented in different ways for the different types of optimizers, but all have the same purpose.
* **Classes encapsulate behavior:** Ex.: Line 51 in optimizer.h. The optimize method is implemented in different ways for the different types of optimizers, but all have the same purpose.
* **Classes follow an appropriate inheritance hierarchy:** Several places in the code. Ex.: Line 10 in sa_optimizer.h and line 10 in ga_optimizer.h.
* **Derived class functions override virtual base class functions:** Line 19 in runtimegui.h. The method notify is a pure virtual method that must be overrided. Line 44 in runtimegui.h overrides.
* **The project makes use of references in function declarations:** Ex.: Line 44 in runtimegui.h takes references as input parameters.
* **The project uses smart pointers instead of raw pointers:** A smart pointer to the optimizer is defined in the main.cpp file.
